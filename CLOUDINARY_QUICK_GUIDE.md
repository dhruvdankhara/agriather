✅ **Ready to use!**

## 🚀 How to Use

### **1. Add Product (Frontend - No Changes Needed)**

```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("name", "Fresh Tomatoes");
formData.append("price", 50);
formData.append("unit", "kg");
formData.append("images", file1);
formData.append("images", file2);

await productAPI.create(formData);
```

### **2. Backend Handles Upload Automatically**

```javascript
// Controller receives files from multer
// Uploads to Cloudinary
// Saves URLs to database
// Deletes local files
// All automatic! 🎉
```
