# Cloudinary Image Upload Implementation

## ✅ Complete Implementation

Product images are now uploaded to **Cloudinary** instead of local storage for better scalability and CDN delivery.

---

## 📋 What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Cloudinary Utility** (`backend/src/utils/cloudinary.js`)

#### New Functions:

```javascript
// Upload single image
uploadImage(localPath, (folder = "products"));
// Returns: { url: "https://...", publicId: "..." }

// Upload multiple images
uploadMultipleImages(files, (folder = "products"));
// Returns: [{ url: "...", publicId: "..." }, ...]

// Delete single image
deleteImage(publicId);

// Delete multiple images
deleteMultipleImages(publicIds);
```

#### Features:

- ✅ Automatic folder organization (`agriather/products`)
- ✅ Secure HTTPS URLs
- ✅ Auto-cleanup of local files after upload
- ✅ Error handling with fallbacks
- ✅ Promise-based batch operations
- ✅ Detailed console logging for debugging

---

### 2. **Updated Product Controller** (`backend/src/controllers/product.controller.js`)

#### **Create Product:**

```javascript
// Before: Saved to local /images folder
const images = req.files.map((file) => `/images/${file.filename}`);

// After: Upload to Cloudinary
const uploadedImages = await uploadMultipleImages(
  req.files,
  "agriather/products"
);
const imageUrls = uploadedImages.map((img) => img.url);
```

#### **Update Product:**

- ✅ Upload new images to Cloudinary
- ✅ Append to existing images
- ✅ Support for removing images via array update

#### **Delete Product:**

- ✅ Extracts Cloudinary public IDs from URLs
- ✅ Deletes all product images from Cloudinary
- ✅ Then deletes product from database

## 🔧 Environment Variables Required

Add these to your `backend/.env` file:

```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

### How to Get Cloudinary Credentials:

1. **Sign up** at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Go to **Dashboard**
3. Copy your credentials:
   - Cloud Name
   - API Key
   - API Secret

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Upload Flow:**

1. **Frontend** → Sends FormData with image files
2. **Multer Middleware** → Saves files temporarily to `./public/images/`
3. **Controller** → Calls `uploadMultipleImages(req.files)`
4. **Cloudinary Utility** → Uploads each file to Cloudinary
5. **Cloudinary** → Returns secure HTTPS URLs
6. **Controller** → Saves URLs to database
7. **Cleanup** → Local files automatically deleted
8. **Response** → Product created with Cloudinary image URLs

### **Storage Structure:**

```
Cloudinary
└── agriather/
    └── products/
        ├── product-image-1697558400000.jpg
        ├── product-image-1697558401000.jpg
        └── product-image-1697558402000.jpg
```

### **Image URLs:**

```
Before (Local):
/images/product-image-1697558400000.jpg

After (Cloudinary):
https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud/image/upload/v1697558400/agriather/products/product-image-1697558400000.jpg
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Create Product:

- [x] Upload 1 image → Cloudinary URL saved
- [x] Upload 5 images → All uploaded to Cloudinary
- [x] Upload with no images → Works without errors
- [x] Local files deleted after upload

### Update Product:

- [x] Add new images → Appended to existing
- [x] Update without images → Existing images preserved

### Delete Product:

- [x] Product deleted → Images removed from Cloudinary
- [x] Check Cloudinary dashboard → Images gone

### Error Handling:

- [x] Invalid Cloudinary credentials → Error logged
- [x] Upload fails → Local file still cleaned up
- [x] Network error → Graceful failure

## 📊 Image Management

### **Folder Structure:**

```
agriather/
├── products/        # Product images
├── users/           # User avatars (future)
└── categories/      # Category images (future)
```

### **Naming Convention:**

- Multer generates: `product-name-1697558400000.jpg`
- Stored in: `agriather/products/`
- Full path: `agriather/products/product-name-1697558400000`

## 🚀 Performance

### **Before (Local Storage):**

- ❌ Slow load times
- ❌ Server bandwidth consumed
- ❌ No optimization
- ❌ Single server location

### **After (Cloudinary):**

- ✅ Fast CDN delivery
- ✅ Zero server bandwidth
- ✅ Auto-optimized images
- ✅ Global edge servers

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **Images not uploading?**

1. Check `.env` has correct Cloudinary credentials
2. Verify Cloudinary account is active
3. Check console for error messages
4. Ensure `public/images` folder exists

### **Local files not deleted?**

- Check file permissions
- Verify `fs.unlinkSync()` is called in try/catch

### **Images not showing?**

- Verify URLs in database are Cloudinary URLs
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Ensure Cloudinary URLs are HTTPS
