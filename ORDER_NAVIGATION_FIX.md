# Order Details Navigation Fix

## Issue

Clicking "View Order Details" button in the Orders page was redirecting to the home page instead of showing the order details.

## Root Cause

**Path Mismatch** between the navigation link and the route configuration:

- **Orders.jsx** was using: `/customer/orders/${order._id}`
- **routes/index.jsx** was configured as: `/orders/:id`

The extra `/customer` prefix in the navigation link didn't match any route, so React Router redirected to the fallback route (home page).

## Solution

### Fixed Navigation Paths

#### 1. Orders Page (`client/src/pages/customer/Orders.jsx`)

**Before:**

```jsx
<Link to={`/customer/orders/${order._id}`}>View Details</Link>
```

**After:**

```jsx
<Link to={`/orders/${order._id}`}>View Details</Link>
```

#### 2. OrderDetail Page (`client/src/pages/customer/OrderDetail.jsx`)

**Before:**

```jsx
navigate("/customer/orders");
```

**After:**

```jsx
navigate("/orders");
```

Fixed in two places:

- "View All Orders" button (order not found page)
- "Back to Orders" button (top of order detail page)

## Why This Works

### Route Structure

The customer routes are configured under the root `/` path with the `CustomerLayout`:

```jsx
<Route path="/" element={<CustomerLayout />}>
  <Route path="orders" element={<Orders />} />
  <Route path="orders/:id" element={<OrderDetail />} />
</Route>
```

This means:

- Orders list: `/orders` ✅
- Order detail: `/orders/:id` ✅
- NOT: `/customer/orders` ❌

### Consistent Paths

All customer routes follow this pattern:

- `/products` - Products page
- `/cart` - Cart page
- `/checkout` - Checkout page
- `/orders` - Orders page
- `/orders/:id` - Order detail page
- `/profile` - Profile page

No `/customer` prefix is needed because they're already nested under the CustomerLayout.

## Testing

### Test the Fix:

1. ✅ Go to `/orders` (My Orders page)
2. ✅ Click "View Details" button on any order
3. ✅ Should navigate to `/orders/:orderId`
4. ✅ Should show the order detail page
5. ✅ Click "Back to Orders"
6. ✅ Should return to `/orders`

### Verify All Paths:

```
✅ /orders → Orders list page
✅ /orders/123abc → Order detail page
✅ After checkout → Navigates to /orders
✅ Back button → Returns to /orders
✅ Order not found → "View All Orders" goes to /orders
```

## Files Modified

1. **client/src/pages/customer/Orders.jsx**

   - Changed link from `/customer/orders/${order._id}` to `/orders/${order._id}`

2. **client/src/pages/customer/OrderDetail.jsx**
   - Changed navigation from `/customer/orders` to `/orders` (2 places)

## Related Files (No Changes Needed)

✅ **client/src/routes/index.jsx** - Routes are correctly configured  
✅ **client/src/pages/customer/Checkout.jsx** - Already uses correct path `/orders`

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and Tested
**Issue:** Navigation path mismatch
**Solution:** Removed `/customer` prefix from navigation links
