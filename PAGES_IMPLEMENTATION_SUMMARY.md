## Pages Still Using Placeholders

These pages have functional structure but some features may need backend API completion:

1. **Supplier Pages:**

   - Payments
   - Reports
   - Reviews

2. **Admin Pages:**
   - Suppliers Management
   - Customers Management
   - Categories Management
   - Orders Management
   - Payments Management
   - Reviews Management
   - Reports

These can be completed once the backend MongoDB issue is resolved and APIs are tested.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix MongoDB Module Corruption**

   - Backend server won't start due to missing operations/search_indexes/update file
   - Need to downgrade mongodb package or manually add missing file

2. **Test All API Integrations**

   - Once backend is running, test all CRUD operations
   - Verify data flow between frontend and backend
   - Test authentication flows

3. **Complete Remaining Pages**

   - Implement supplier payment history
   - Implement supplier reports
   - Implement all admin management pages
   - Add category management CRUD

4. **Add Missing Features**

   - Product image upload
   - Real-time notifications
   - Order tracking with timeline
   - Payment gateway integration
   - Advanced search and filters

5. **Enhancements**
   - Add loading skeletons instead of spinners
   - Implement infinite scroll for products
   - Add wishlist functionality
   - Implement bulk actions for admin
   - Add data export features (CSV/PDF)
