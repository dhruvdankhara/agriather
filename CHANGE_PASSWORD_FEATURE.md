# Change Password Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The change password feature has been successfully implemented, allowing users to securely update their passwords from their profile page.

## Backend Implementation

### API Endpoint

- **Route**: `PUT /auth/change-password`
- **Authentication**: Required (JWT)
- **Location**: `backend/src/routes/auth.routes.js`

### Controller

**File**: `backend/src/controllers/auth.controller.js`

```javascript
export const changePassword = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const { currentPassword, newPassword } = req.body;

  // Validation
  if (!currentPassword || !newPassword) {
    throw new ApiError(400, "Current password and new password are required");
  }

  if (newPassword.length < 6) {
    throw new ApiError(400, "New password must be at least 6 characters long");
  }

  // Verify current password
  const user = await User.findById(req.user._id);
  const isPasswordValid = await user.isPasswordCorrect(currentPassword);

  if (!isPasswordValid) {
    throw new ApiError(400, "Current password is incorrect");
  }

  // Update password
  user.password = newPassword;
  await user.save();

  return res
    .status(200)
    .json(new ApiResponse(200, "Password changed successfully", null));
});
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "currentPassword": "string",
  "newPassword": "string"
}
```

### Validation Schema

**File**: `backend/src/validators/auth.schema.js`

```javascript
export const changePasswordSchema = yup.object({
  currentPassword: yup.string().required("Current password is required"),
  newPassword: yup
    .string()
    .required("New password is required")
    .min(6, "Password must be at least 6 characters"),
});
```

### Response

**Success (200)**:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "message": "Password changed successfully",
  "data": null
}
```

**Error (400)**:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "Current password is incorrect" // or validation error
}
```

## Frontend Implementation

### UI Components

**File**: `client/src/pages/customer/Profile.jsx`

#### Password Management Card

- Located between Profile Information and Address Management sections
- Toggle-able form (shows/hides on button click)
- Green theme to match the app design
- Includes Lock and Key icons for visual clarity

#### Form Fields

1. **Current Password** - Validates against stored password
2. **New Password** - Minimum 6 characters
3. **Confirm New Password** - Must match new password

### Features

- ✅ Real-time validation
- ✅ Password matching check
- ✅ Minimum length validation (6 characters)
- ✅ Loading states during submission
- ✅ Success/error toast notifications
- ✅ Form reset after successful change
- ✅ Cancel button to close form

### Redux Integration

**File**: `client/src/store/slices/authSlice.js`

```javascript
export const changePassword = createAsyncThunk(
  "auth/changePassword",
  async (data, { rejectWithValue }) => {
    try {
      const response = await authAPI.changePassword(data);
      toast.success("Password changed successfully");
      return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error(error.response?.data?.message || "Password change failed");
      return rejectWithValue(error.response?.data);
    }
  }
);
```

### API Service

**File**: `client/src/services/index.js`

```javascript
changePassword: (data) => api.put('/auth/change-password', data),
```

## Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: Only authenticated users can change passwords
2. **Current Password Verification**: Must provide correct current password
3. **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed before storage (via User model)
4. **Minimum Length**: Enforced 6-character minimum
5. **Client-side Validation**: Prevents unnecessary API calls

## User Flow

1. User navigates to Profile page
2. Clicks "Change Password" button in Password & Security section
3. Form appears with three fields
4. User enters current password and new password (twice)
5. Form validates:
   - All fields filled
   - New password ≥ 6 characters
   - New passwords match
6. On submit, API verifies current password
7. If valid, password is updated
8. Success message shown, form closes and resets
9. If invalid, error message shown

## Changes Made

### Backend

- ✅ Updated field name from `oldPassword` to `currentPassword` in controller
- ✅ Added validation for required fields in controller
- ✅ Added minimum length validation in controller
- ✅ Updated validation schema field name

### Frontend

- ✅ Added password change imports (changePassword action, Lock, Key icons)
- ✅ Added state management for password form
- ✅ Created password change handler with validation
- ✅ Added Password & Security card UI
- ✅ Implemented toggle show/hide password form
- ✅ Added responsive form with proper validation
- ✅ Integrated with Redux store

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test with correct current password
- [ ] Test with incorrect current password
- [ ] Test with new password < 6 characters
- [ ] Test with mismatched new passwords
- [ ] Test with empty fields
- [ ] Test cancel button functionality
- [ ] Test form reset after successful change
- [ ] Test toast notifications
- [ ] Test loading states
- [ ] Test on mobile devices

## Error Handling

- **Frontend**: Toast notifications for all error cases
- **Backend**: Appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
- **Validation**: Both client-side and server-side validation

## Notes

- Password hashing is handled automatically by the User model's pre-save hook
- The endpoint was already defined in routes but had field name mismatch
- Validation schema exists but isn't currently applied via middleware in routes
- Frontend validation prevents most invalid requests from reaching the server
