## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries Optimization

- Aggregation pipelines for efficient calculations
- Date range queries with proper indexing
- Limited recent activity to 5 items each
- Top categories limited to 5 items

### Suggested Indexes

```javascript
// Users collection
db.users.createIndex({ createdAt: -1 });
db.users.createIndex({ role: 1, isApproved: 1 });

// Orders collection
db.orders.createIndex({ createdAt: -1 });
db.orders.createIndex({ status: 1 });

// Products collection
db.products.createIndex({ stock: 1, isActive: 1 });
db.products.createIndex({ category: 1 });

// Payments collection
db.payments.createIndex({ status: 1, createdAt: -1 });

// Reviews collection
db.reviews.createIndex({ createdAt: -1 });
db.reviews.createIndex({ rating: 1 });
```
