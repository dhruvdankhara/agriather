## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

2. **Setup environment:**

   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update MongoDB URL and other configs

3. **Seed database:**

   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

   This creates:

   - Admin user: admin@agriather.com / admin123
   - Supplier: supplier@test.com / supplier123
   - Customer: customer@test.com / customer123
   - Sample categories

4. **Start server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Server runs on http://localhost:8000

5. **Test API:**
   - Use Postman/Thunder Client
   - Import endpoints from API_DOCUMENTATION.md
   - Login to get JWT token
   - Use token in subsequent requests

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication:** JWT + Bcrypt
- **Validation:** Yup
- **File Upload:** Multer
- **Logging:** Morgan

## 🔄 Business Logic Flow

### Order Flow:

1. Customer adds products to cart
2. Customer creates order from cart
3. Payment record created (pending)
4. Customer processes payment
5. Order status: pending → confirmed
6. Supplier updates: processing → shipped
7. Order delivered
8. Customer can review products

### Supplier Approval Flow:

1. Supplier registers account
2. Admin reviews application
3. Admin approves/rejects
4. Approved suppliers can list products

### Stock Management:

- Stock reduced on order creation
- Stock restored on order cancellation
- Real-time stock validation

## 📝 Environment Variables

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Suggested improvements:

- [ ] Real-time notifications (WebSocket)
- [ ] Advanced search (Elasticsearch)
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] SMS notifications
- [ ] Payment gateway integration (Razorpay/Stripe)
- [ ] Image upload to Cloudinary
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] API documentation (Swagger)
- [ ] Unit and integration tests
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline

## 📚 Available NPM Scripts

```bash
npm start      # Start production server
npm run dev    # Start development server with nodemon
npm run seed   # Seed database with test data
```

## 🐛 Notes

1. **Payment Processing:** Currently uses mock implementation. Integrate actual payment gateway for production.

2. **Image Upload:** Cloudinary setup is prepared but needs credentials in `.env`.

3. **Email Service:** Email configuration is ready but needs SMTP credentials.

4. **Type:** Using CommonJS module system (can be converted to ES6 modules).
